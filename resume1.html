   <p>It is hard to remember what I wanted to be as a child because of how my dreams were always changing.</p>
   <p> At some point I wanted to be an actor, lawyer, geologist the list is endless. However I distinctively</p>
   <p>remember falling in love with technology. Fortunate enough I had the opportunity to attend college and </p>
   <p>I'll forever value every moment. I went on to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree </p>
   <p> which I completed. I'm currently studying Postgraduate Diploma in Information Technology Management and being</p>
   <p>a front-end developer. I believe education opens an endless array of doors. I am a hardworking individual with</p>
   <p>proven excellent communication skills. I thrive in any working environment and could add value in a work area that</p>
   <p>will enable me to use my strong organization skills, ability to work well with people and can work according to timeliness.</p>
